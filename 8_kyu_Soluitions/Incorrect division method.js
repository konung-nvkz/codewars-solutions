/*Incorrect division method
This method, which is supposed to return the result of dividing its first argument 
by its second, isn't always returning correct values. Fix it.*/

const solve = (x, y) => x / y

// instead of // we need to leave / only. 
// we don't need to comment, we need to divide, right?
