/*Swap Values
DESCRIPTION:
I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.

Can you figure out what's wrong here?

function swapValues(arr) {
    //     var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    //     var temp = args[0];
    //     args[0] = args[1];
    //     args[1] = temp;
        return arr.reverse()
}
//Comment on code
//initial code does different thing from what it is supposed to do.
// insrtead we use reverse method to change array
