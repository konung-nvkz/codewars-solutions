# codewars-tasks-solutions

<h1> Information.</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
This repo represents my variants of <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/" alt="https://www.codewars.com/kata/"> Codewars kata</a>  solutions. Sometimes ifelses, sometimes more complicated variants. Simply JS. 

<h3> Long description</h3>
In broad sence it is not a program, just a description from the author of the tasks put in the beginning of the file and pieces of code - my attempts to solve the task.
If I have mood to create more than one solution, I will add it up.
In this case I am likely to rename function in order to avoid errors in VScode or elsewhere.
That means code will not work in Codewars, though the concept is correct.
As I only study how to work with JS (and sometimes Python), most solutions are obvius for experienced programmers. I am also not that good at algorithms, so sometimes my solutions have complexity of O(n) where it can be O(log(n)) or even O(1).
Please keep that in mind.

<h2>Comments.</h2>
In some cases I add up comments.
That doesn't look professional.
Commments are obvious for mature programmers.
It is a bad practice.
I know. I know.s
Deal with it. I do comments for me.
May be later That will be done better.

<h2> Structure </h2>

Files are put to folders according to ther complexity at Codewars.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/5_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 5 kyu solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/6_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 6 kyu solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/7_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 7 kyu solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/8_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 8 kyu solutions</a></li>
</ul>

Files are named the same they are in Codewars site.
List is added each time I get to some new task.


<h2> Plans for development: </h2>

Some day in future when I become older and decide to do a catalogue, this may lead to a wevsite with solutions. But please remember the quote:
