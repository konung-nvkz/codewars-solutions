# codewars-tasks-solutions

<h1> Information.</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
This repo represents my variants of <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/" alt="https://www.codewars.com/kata/"> Codewars kata</a>  solutions. Sometimes ifelses, sometimes more complicated variants. Simply JS. 

<h3> Long description</h3>
In broad sence it is not a single program, just a description from the author of the tasks put in the beginning of the file and pieces of code - my attempts to solve the task.
If I have mood to create more than one solution, I will add it up.
In this case I am likely to rename function in order to avoid errors in VScode or elsewhere.
That means code will not work in Codewars, though the concept is correct.
As I only study how to work with JS (and sometimes Python), most solutions are obvious for experienced programmers.
Please keep that in mind.
<h2> Structure </h2>

Files are put to folders according to their complexity at Codewars.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/5_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 5 kyu solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/6_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 6 kyu solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/7_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 7 kyu solutions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/tree/main/8_kyu_Solutions"> Folder for 8 kyu solutions</a></li>
</ul>

Most files usually (but not necessary) have the same structure:

<h3> Description</h3>

Description from Codewars kata. Is commented. Contains the name of Kata, and information that katas author has given.
Necessary part of the file.

May look like this:

<img src="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/blob/main/files_for_examples/01_description.png" alt="description">

<h3> Solution</h3>
My variant (or several variants) of task solution.
Usually represents a JS function, more rarely, some other functions.
Necessary part of the file.
May look like this:

<img src="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/blob/main/files_for_examples/02_solution.png" alt="solution">

<h3>Comments</h3>

Unnecessary section. In most cases the code is obvious and I don't add comments at all.
That doesn't look professional.
Commments are obvious for mature programmers.
It is a bad practice.
I know. I know.
Deal with it. I do comments for me. Sometimes I need notes to understand how it works after time. By this time rules for JS may change.

May look like this:

<img src="https://github.com/konung-nvkz/codewars-tasks-solutions/blob/main/files_for_examples/03_comments.png" alt="comments">

<h3>Test cases</h3>
Also an unnecessary section. Sometimes I need to check whether my function works before commiting it. Yes, I understand it is a bad practice to have console.logs everywhere.
May be some day I will start writing correct test cases.
At the moment may look like this:

<h2>Further notes.</h2>
Files are named the same they are in Codewars site. sometimes system doesn't alllow to use some symbols like punctuation marks and I have to exclude them from filename. In this case please see description inside the file.
List of files is added each time I get to some new task.

<h2> Plans for development: </h2>

Some day in future when I become older and decide to do a catalogue, this may lead to a website with solutions. But please remember the quote:
