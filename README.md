# codewars-tasks-solutions

My variants of codewars tasks. Sometimes ifelses, sometimes more complicated variants. Simply JS
As I only study how to work with JS (and sometimes Python), most solutions are easy.
In some cases I will add comments, even if they are obvious for mature programmers.
How I now consider it to look, I will add up folders like 6kyu, 7kyu, etc., and add up .js files named the same they are in codewars site.
If I have mood to create more than one solution, I will add it up and rename function in order to avoid errors in VScode or elsewhere.
Have a great day!
Will add up files here
